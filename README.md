# Who are we :

# The idea:
-A system which takes a person unconsciously to be better without even noticing so it takes him from zero to hero
-a badge or award and divide it into like 30 days .so the badge is now an incomplete puzzle, every time u do the job u take a photo so u fill one piece in the puzzle until u finish the 30 days so u earn the badge (your profile will show the earned badges after that)

-Why not take all the taken photos and save it so when the challenge ends to make a video slideshow. this will make people take good photos from day one to day 30 and then will be saved in the private section in ur profile so u wonâ€™t  forget the first time u played yoga (documentation is very important)
-Group challenges: one badge and all are fighting for the same one winner gets it
-Badge rarity (Legendary, rare, common, exotic)
-Custom badges
